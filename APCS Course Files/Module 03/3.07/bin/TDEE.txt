 PMR: 
 Only issued encountered was an issue where I was not getting the raw value of strings,
 and therefore the if statements were not working. After a few minutes of debugging, 
 I realized I had not used the .valueOf method and therefore the if statement
 was running, but not as intended. Otherwise, no issues were encountered.
