 Overall program development went very well. Only issue encountered was the terminal shutdown in VS Code for a minute, but after clearing the window cache this issue was fixed.
 --EDIT--
 An error was reported due to the fact that the ticket amount/price inputs were ints. 
 They were changed to doubles.
