 Experience was all OK with this project. Only problem was a slight issue with logic on my end with the currency conversion rate. 

 After a quick rethink, everything was fixed and program ran normally. 

 No compile/build errors were encountered, and VS Code was used with Microsoft's Java Integrations.
