Variables Used
Force - (Measured in Newton) - Force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity.
Mass 1 - (Measured in Kilogram) - Mass 1 is the quantity of matter in a body 1 regardless of its volume or of any forces acting on it.
Mass 2 - (Measured in Kilogram) - Mass 2 is the quantity of matter in a body 2 regardless of its volume or of any forces acting on it.
Radius - (Measured in Meter) - Radius is a radial line from the focus to any point of a curve.
